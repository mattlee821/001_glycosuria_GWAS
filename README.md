trimester of pregnancy in ALSPAC*

We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of glycosuria (sugar
in urine) in pregnant mothers from the Avon Longitudinal Study of
Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Due to a lack of available external data
sources replication was not possible, instead we performed a GWAS in the
Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 (NFBC1986) where we used mothers
phenotype and the mothersâ€™ offsprings genotype. To estimate the maternal
effects from offspring genotypes we doubled the effect estimates and
standard errors of the GWAS results (see:
