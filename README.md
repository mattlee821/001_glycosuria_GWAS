### Summary

This GitHub repo hosts all scripts used in the analysis for the paper of
a GWAS of glycosuria. It also hosts a copy of the manuscript, figures,
tables and supplementary material.

### Scripts

All of the scripts use relative file paths - `./my/file/path` - where
`./` is the directory `001_glycosuria_GWAS` from which I run all
scripts.
